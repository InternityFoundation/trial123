Problem Statement:
To produce a forecast model of agricultural produce through available real-time farm
parameters:
(sunlight, temperature, humidity, electrical conductivity, rainfall). Capture the data with all this
information. The idea is to get the data in the platform or upload the excel data (via .csv, .txt
or xml) to the application, compare with the historical farm parameter data, develop a
model/algorithm & be able to forecast yield and display the output of the past 3 and next 3
months. To integrate the application with a social media module (say a farmer’s network) or
a community (of botanists, entomologists) and be able to provide answers to real farm
problems – pests, leaf conditions etc. within 24 hours.
